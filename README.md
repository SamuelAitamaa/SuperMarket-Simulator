# SuperMarket-Simulator
This project was made during the first period of second year in Metropolia UAS.
It is a simulator for a typical supermarket, that takes in a lot of parameteres These consist the following:

* Self-service checkout (open or closed)
* Number of traditional checkouts (1-6)
* Simulation time (seconds)
* Delay (milliseconds)
* Average time between customers arriving
* Deviation for the time mentioned above

In addition to these the user interface has buttons to increase or decrease the previously set delay time. These functions operate to clarify the visual presentation
of the simulation. As well as these the UI has a start button, which turns into stop button once it's playing, and buttons to review the results and save them into a
.xls Excel file.

The simulator is implemented with MVC-architecture and with technologies listed below.
